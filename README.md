# Disaster Resilience System

An AI-powered disaster management and response system designed to improve emergency response, victim detection, and aid coordination during natural disasters.

## Problem Statement
Natural disasters cause massive loss of life and resources. Manual coordination is slow, fragmented, and inefficient. There is a need for intelligent systems that can analyze data quickly, detect victims, and support rescue teams with actionable insights.

## Proposed Solution
The Disaster Resilience System integrates Artificial Intelligence, drones, geospatial technologies, and mobile/cloud platforms to:

- Detect disaster-affected zones
- Locate trapped or missing persons
- Provide updated maps and travel advisories
- Coordinate shelters and emergency resources
- Notify families and responders in real time

## Key Technologies
- Artificial Intelligence (Computer Vision, Data Analysis)
- Drone-based aerial reconnaissance
- Geospatial systems (GIS, GPS, Remote Sensing)
- Cloud platforms (e.g., Azure)
- Mobile and web applications

## System Capabilities
- Drone image capture and live video feed
- AI-based victim detection and damage assessment
- Face recognition to identify missing persons
- Offline processing during network outages
- Emergency notifications and alerts
- Shelter management (capacity, location, population)

## Impact
- Faster disaster response
- Reduced loss of life
- Better resource allocation
- Improved situational awareness for rescue teams

## Alignment with SDGs
Supports **UN SDG 9** — Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure by promoting resilient infrastructure and technological innovation.
